Real-Time Chat Application with WebSockets
This project is a simple real-time chat application that enables multiple users to communicate with each other over WebSockets. The application uses Spring Boot for the backend, STOMP as the messaging protocol over WebSockets, and SockJS for fallback transport if WebSockets are not supported by the browser. The frontend is built using HTML, Thymeleaf, and JavaScript.
